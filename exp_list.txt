1. 
    1. Write Assembly language program for a hypothetical
       machine for factorial of a number in the format below. Also
       construct symbol table for the same.
    2. Write Assembly language program for adding 3 numbers.
    3. Write a program that reads a text file and count number
       of lines, blank spaces occurs and displays the results in
       another text file.
2. 
    For any Assembly input for a hypothetical machine,
    implement pass 1 by displaying Symbol Table, LiteralTable
    and POOLTAB and intermediate code.
3. 
    Implement pass 2 by using the intermediate code
    generated as input to pass 2 program which was
    generated as output in pass 1.
4.
    Design and Implement Pass 1 of a Macro processor Task: Write a program
    to read a given text file which can identify the macros in the program and
    display MNT, MDT and Argument List Array
5.
    Create two libraries, and one program which will use those libraries.
6.
    Write lexical analyzer to identify tokens for c Language like identifier,
    literals, open curly brace, end curly brace, semicolon,ignore white
    space.
7.
    Write a program to recognize valid arithmetic
    expression that uses operators + , -,* and / using YACC
8. 
    Implement Intermediate Code Generation and convert
    infix expression to postfix expression.(Yacc parser)
