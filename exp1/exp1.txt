1. Assembly Language Program for Factorial Calculation:

; Factorial Calculation Program
; Input: R1 contains the number for which factorial is to be calculated
; Output: R2 contains the factorial of the input number

START:
    MOV R2, #1      ; Initialize result to 1
    MOV R3, #1      ; Initialize loop counter to 1
    
LOOP:
    MUL R2, R2, R3  ; Multiply result by current loop counter
    ADD R3, R3, #1  ; Increment loop counter
    CMP R3, R1      ; Compare loop counter with input number
    BLT LOOP        ; If loop counter < input number, continue loop

    ; Factorial calculation completed, result is in R2
    HALT            ; End program

2. Assembly Language Program for Adding 3 Numbers:

; Program to add three numbers
; Input: R1, R2, R3 contain the three numbers to be added
; Output: R4 contains the sum of the three numbers

START:
    ADD R4, R1, R2  ; Add first two numbers
    ADD R4, R4, R3  ; Add third number to the sum
    HALT            ; End program

3. Program to Read Text File, Count Lines and Blank Spaces, and Write Results to Another Text File:
; Program to read a text file, count lines and blank spaces,
; and write results to another text file

START:
    ; Open input file
    ; (Assuming file is already opened and file handle is in R1)
    
    MOV R2, #0      ; Initialize line count
    MOV R3, #0      ; Initialize blank space count
    
READ_LOOP:
    ; Read a character from file into R4
    ; Check if end of file reached, if so, jump to END_READ
    
    CMP R4, '\n'    ; Compare current character with newline character
    BEQ INCREMENT_LINE_COUNT
    
    CMP R4, ' '     ; Compare current character with space character
    BEQ INCREMENT_SPACE_COUNT
    
    ; Continue reading characters until end of file
    
    JMP READ_LOOP

INCREMENT_LINE_COUNT:
    ADD R2, R2, #1  ; Increment line count
    JMP READ_LOOP   ; Continue reading
    
INCREMENT_SPACE_COUNT:
    ADD R3, R3, #1  ; Increment blank space count
    JMP READ_LOOP   ; Continue reading
    
END_READ:
    ; Close input file
    
    ; Open output file
    ; (Assuming file is already opened and file handle is in R5)
    
    ; Write line count to output file
    ; Write blank space count to output file
    
    ; Close output file
    
    HALT            ; End program
